This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving dangling pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits this error, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to modify a vector through a raw pointer after the vector has gone out of scope.  This highlights the importance of careful memory management in unsafe Rust code.  See the comments within the source files for more detailed explanations.
